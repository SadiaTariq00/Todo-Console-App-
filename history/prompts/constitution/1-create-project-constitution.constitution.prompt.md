## Prompt

```text
You are Spec-Kit Plus operating in Constitution mode.

Project Name: In-Memory Python Console Todo App
Phase: Phase I – Basic Level

Your task is to generate a CONSTITUTION.md file that strictly governs how this project must be developed using spec-driven and agentic workflows.

CONSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS:

1. Development Methodology
- The project must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow:
  Write specification → Generate implementation plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code
- Manual coding by the developer is strictly forbidden.
- All Python code must be generated by Claude Code.

2. Specification Rules
- Every feature must originate from a written specification.
- Specifications must be versioned and stored in the /specs folder.
- No implementation is allowed without an approved spec.

3. Technical Constraints
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Project type: Console-based application
- Data storage: In-memory only (no files, no database)
- Dependency management must use UV.
- Clean code principles must be followed (single responsibility, clear naming).

4. Application Scope
- The application must support only the following basic features:
  - Add task
  - Delete task
  - Update task
  - View task list
  - Mark task as complete/incomplete
- Each task must contain:
  - Auto-incremented ID
  - Title
  - Description
  - Completion status

5. Code Structure Rules
- Source code must reside inside the /src directory.
- Business logic must be separated from CLI handling.
- Data models must be clearly defined.

6. Documentation Requirements
- README.md must include setup and run instructions.
- CLAUDE.md must define how Claude Code should be used in this project.
- The Constitution is authoritative and cannot be bypassed.

7. Quality & Review
- Code must be readable, modular, and minimal.
- Any deviation from the Constitution invalidates the submission.

Generate the CONSTITUTION.md file accordingly.
```

## Response snapshot

Constitution file created with all required principles and governance rules. The file includes:
- Core principles covering Agentic Dev Stack workflow, specification-first development, Python 3.13+ standard, in-memory data storage, clean code architecture, and UV dependency management
- Technical constraints section
- Application scope with required features
- Documentation requirements
- Quality and review standards
- Governance section with versioning

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created authoritative constitution file that governs all development activities for the project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Project can now proceed with specification creation following the constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution establishes clear rules for spec-driven development workflow

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with specification creation following the established constitution
